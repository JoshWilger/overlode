# Project Info

A solo project made in over three months with the goals of learning the game engine Unity, gaining experience in creating a full game, and recreating a flash game favorite called "[Motherload](https://www.crazygames.com/game/motherload)". Starting off by following [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii-scMenaOQ&list=PLrnPJCHvNZuCVTz6lvhR81nnaf1a-b67U&index=1) to learn basic player movement, animations, and collisions, the project took off with designing each specific mechanic in Motherload from scratch, such as mining, health, upgrades, items, proceedural generation, and a whole lot more. The project also involved making many improvements from the original, such as more simplistic user interfaces, upbeat and mulitrack background music, and more details and animations throughout the whole game.
