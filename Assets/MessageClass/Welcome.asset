  - Oh boy, another recruit. I hope you last a little longer than the others. There's
    been a lot of turnover ever since the new CEO's been heading up this whole mining
    operation... (click the gray arrow)
  - What we've brought you here for is to collect minerals and bring them to the
    surface for processing. We got a few automated shops to help you out; some that
    keep you alive, others that upgrade your equipment...
  - Regardless, your suit is probably not fully charged, so head over to the charging
    station to the left. You'll definitely want to keep an eye on that charging level,
    as it's the main way you'll stay alive...
  - Also, keep in mind that the deeper you go, the better resources there are. Good
    luck out there.
