  - I am very impressed! You've made it much farther than I anticipated! I've wired
    you another bonus for your excellent work...
  - You'll definitely want to watch out for natural gas pockets - they're undetectable
    and very deadly...
  - 'Oh, another thing: your altimeter can only go up to 900m - after that, you need
    to turn back. Trust me, it''s far too dangerous for any equipment to handle.'
